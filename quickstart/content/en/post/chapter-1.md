My introduction into the coffee world is probably very similar to anyone born and raised in New England: Dunkin Donuts. The earliest drink I can remember getting from Dunks was when I was in high school. It was their Hazelnut Coffee Coolata - a blended ice heavy-on-the-quotation-marks “coffee” drink that must’ve been 98% sugar and 2% coffee, served in an American-large plastic cup with a bright orange and pink straw. In classic New England fashion, ordering a cold coffee is graciously accepted year-round. Eventually my drink of choice evolved to iced coffee with plenty of cream and sugar, still mainly from the DD chain just south of my parent’s house. If I traveled to a city, I’d get to visit what I considered at the time a big step up: Starbucks. Here I wouldn’t vary too much from my usual sugary frozen coffee drink so I’d get a Java Chip Frappuccino on the recommendation of my older sister.

In the winter of my junior year of high school, my friend Hedda and I went to a small coffee shop near the Dartmouth College campus. It was here I had my first cappuccino. It was served in a small, white cup with a thick handle on a matching white saucer. I had no comparisons on taste, so I was surprised when Hedda expressed her disappointment saying that the milk was burnt. Well it certainly didn’t look black or charred to me! 

Moving on to my college years (which were naturally fueled by any and all forms of caffeine), I had access to my dad’s blue Hyundai hatchback. My college friends would pile into the clown car, and I’d drive us to the Starbucks across town. I recall drinking a lot of Pike Place drip brew. I thought that adults drink coffee black, so as a newly unsupervised nineteen year old, I believed I was already a mature adult so that’s how I took my coffee too. Without milk, I suffered through grande cup after grande cup of mediocre coffee. Now I’m not saying Pike Place is a bad blend, but it certainly isn’t great when it’s been made multiple hours ago then stored in a tall metal pump container. This pushed me quickly towards milk based espresso drinks, in particular, the latte. 

Made from a shot of espresso, steamed milk, and a bit of milk foam, the latte became my go-to drink everywhere. After graduation, I moved my life to Seattle, Washington, the coffee capitol of the United States (sorry Portland, we can contest this in a later post). Suddenly I was steeped in amazing coffee shops every way I turned. Victrola, Elm, Fulcrum, Monorail, Herkimer, Analog, Anchorhead, Storyville, Ghost Alley, Coffee Works, Espresso Vivace, Cedar & Spokes, Caffe Ladro, Cafe Vita, and the list goes on. Weekends were spent reading books in various coffee shops around the city, ordering eight-ounce lattes that came in a variety of vessels from handmade handleless ceramic mugs to logo-stamped white porcelain cups to thick glass tumblers. 

Over time, I came to know what a good latte tastes like although I didn’t have the vocabulary to explain exactly what made a good latte good. To satisfy my coffee curiosity, my boyfriend and I visited the La Marzocco coffee shop (now operated by Caffe Vita) inside the KEXP radio station to take a class on espresso basics. Topics like the extraction curve, tamping, grind size, what effects the taste of espresso, and allowed us to pull a shot ourselves. Taking the class gave me the first glimpse into the vast world of coffee in the eyes of a barista or coffee connoisseur.

This all lead up to purchasing an espresso machine for our apartment.
