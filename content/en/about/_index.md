What a great question. Like any twenty-something, I'm still trying to figure this one out myself...

I'm an electrical engineer who works on hydropower systems while living in Seattle with my boyfriend of many years and our two adorable dogs. My hobbies include sipping on coffee, listening to murder podcasts, people-watching at local cafes, walking with my dogs, watching TV shows like Bob's Burgers or Schitt's Creek, traveling (when it's not in the middle of a deadly pandemic), reading thrillers, cooking as well as baking, emotional shopping, writing to-do lists I'll never complete, and, as of now, creating this blog.

I'm not by any means trained in the coffee industry; I'm just a woman who is very fascinated by the science and art of making a good cup of coffee. This blog is mainly fueled by that fascination and love, but part of the blog is just a creative outlet for writing and further exploring my relationship to coffee. I'll discuss the books I read, podcasts I hear, articles I puruse, beans I've tried, and shops I wish to visit. I'll dive into the science behind roasting and the art of foaming milk. I will talk about new Starbucks drinks and seasonal favorites at my local cafes. Basically, if it has to do with coffee, I'm excited to write about it.
