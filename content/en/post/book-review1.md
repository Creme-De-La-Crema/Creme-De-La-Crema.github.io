title: "Coffee book review: Coffee is my Superpower"
---	
Part of my exploration of coffee is reading books about coffee. There are many books out there that talk about the history of coffee, where the beans are grown, the roasting process of coffee, and instructions on how to brew it. I'm excited to read books that have any of these topics and more. Afte I've finished a coffee book, I'm going to write a little book report summarizing it and add my thoughts about the book's topics.

This first book is called Coffee is my Superpower by Ryoko Iwata, who is a "Japenese cofffee-lover living in Seattle". I've picked it up at a bookstore because it is a very colorfully illustrated short book that looked like a fun read. Ryoko herself illustrated the majority of the book with one story illustrated by the comic artist The Oatmeal. 

This book is filled with fun facts, cute flowchart that tells you whether or not you need to put coffee in your face right now (hint: you probably need to), informative graphs illustrating the countries with the highest consumers of coffee, and funny drawings of the types of coffee snobs you may encounter.
