Hi friends!

I’m starting a series of blog posts exploring and detailing the life of a coffee bean from Earth’s ground to brewed grounds. I’ll be researching the journey starting on a coffee plantation, continuing through the stages of processing and shipping, all the way through roasting and sales, then finally ending with brewing methods used to enjoy a delicious cup. 
	
My goal is to answer questions that bounce around in my head, as well as answer more basic coffee questions such as:
Where and when does coffee grow? What are the types or varieties of coffee? What is processing and what methods are there? How much caffeine does a cup of coffee contain? What affects brewing?
	
I’ll get into some depth in order to answer some more questions like:
What’s the most expensive aspect of growing coffee? Do whole regions of coffee plants favor certain tasting notes? What does the relationship between farmers and roasters look like? How is coffee graded? Why buy from one farm versus purchasing from another? What is defining fourth wave coffee? Who consumes what kind of coffee, and why? What are certifications or exams for coffee roasters or cuppers?
	
I’m excited to document my coffee knowledge journey, and I’ll be citing some amazing coffee books, blog posts, and videos that have been created by some of the best in the biz. There even may be some original amateur drawings, by yours truly, included in these posts that I will share. 

Go turn your espresso machine or water kettles on and let's get ready to sip & learn!
