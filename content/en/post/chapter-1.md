My introduction into the coffee world is probably very similar to anyone born and raised in New England: Dunkin Donuts. The earliest drink I can remember getting from Dunkin was when I was in high school. It was their Hazelnut Coffee Coolata - a blended ice heavy-on-the-quotation-marks “coffee” drink that must’ve been 98% sugar and 2% coffee and/or coffee flavoring, served in an American-large plastic cup with a bright orange and pink straw. In classic New England fashion, ordering a cold coffee is graciously accepted year-round. Eventually my drink of choice evolved to iced coffee with plenty of cream and sugar, still mainly from the Dunkin chain just south of my parent’s house. If I traveled to a city, I’d get to visit what I considered at the time a boujee treat: Starbucks. Here I wouldn’t vary too much from my usual sugary frozen coffee drink so I’d get a Java Chip Frappuccino with whipped cream and it felt like a step-up from my usual.

In the winter of my junior year of high school, a much more cultured friend and I went to a small coffee shop near the Dartmouth College campus. It was here I had my first cappuccino. It was served in a small, white cup with a thick handle on a matching white saucer. I had no comparisons on taste, so I was surprised when my friend expressed her disappointment saying that the milk was burnt. Well it certainly didn’t look black or charred to me. It was just a hot, but I still enjoyed the foamy drink.

Moving on to my college years (which naturally were fueled by any and all forms of caffeine), I had access to my dad’s blue Hyundai hatchback. My college friends would pile into the clown car, and I’d drive us to the Starbucks across town. I recall drinking a lot of Pike Place drip brew. I thought that adults drink coffee black, so as a newly unsupervised nineteen year old, I believed I was already a mature adult so I took my coffee black too. Without milk, I suffered through grande cup after grande cup of mediocre coffee. Now hey, I’m not saying Pike Place is a bad blend, but it certainly isn’t great when it’s been made multiple hours ago then stored in a tall metal pump container. This pushed me quickly towards milk based espresso drinks, in particular, the latte. 

Made from a shot of espresso, steamed milk, and a bit of milk foam, the latte became my go-to drink everywhere. After graduation, I moved my life to Seattle, Washington, the coffee capitol of the United States (sorry Portland, we can contest this in a later post). Suddenly I had access to amazing coffee shops every way I turned. Just downtown there's Victrola, Elm, Fulcrum, Monorail, Herkimer, Analog, Anchorhead, Storyville, Ghost Alley, Coffee Works, Espresso Vivace, Cedar & Spokes, Caffe Ladro, Caffe Vita, Caffee Umbria, Cafe Hagen, and the list goes on. Weekends were spent reading books in various coffee shops around the city, ordering eight-ounce lattes that came in a variety of vessels from handmade handleless ceramic mugs to logo-stamped white porcelain cups to thick glass tumblers. 

Over time, I came to know what a good latte tastes like, although I didn’t have the vocabulary to explain exactly what made a good latte good. To satisfy my coffee curiosity, my boyfriend and I visited the La Marzocco coffee shop (now operated by Caffe Vita) inside the KEXP radio station to take a class on espresso basics. Topics were covered like the extraction curve, tamping, grind size, and what variables effect a shot of espresso. They also allowed us to pull some shots ourselves. Taking the class gave me the first glimpse into the vast world of coffee in the eyes of a barista or coffee connoisseur.

Finally this lead up to purchasing an espresso machine for our apartment in early-to-mid 2020. With the pandemic in full swing and while teleworking, it was the perfect time to make coffee at home. After some research and asking a few coffee-enthused friends, I landed on the Rocket Appartamento espresso machine along with a Rocket Faustino grinder. To measure the weight of the grounds, we purchased an Acaia Lunar scale. The purchase set us back close to $4,000 USD (with tax), which is certainly not cheap (although it's not as expensive as the La Marzocco Linea Mini which is my current dream machine.)

That brings me close enough to present-day to conclude the walk through my personal coffee history. Since this blog is written by a chronic oversharer who desperately needs creative goals in her life, I'll be posting my ramblings on the intersection of coffee and my life each Sunday. Honestly, I'm unsure where this blog will take me, but I do know that I'll be drinking a delicious latte and learning the whole way.
