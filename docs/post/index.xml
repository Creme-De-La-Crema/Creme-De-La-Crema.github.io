      <description>My introduction into the coffee world is probably very similar to anyone born and raised in New England: Dunkin Donuts. The earliest drink I can remember getting from Dunkin was when I was in high school. It was their Hazelnut Coffee Coolata - a blended ice heavy-on-the-quotation-marks “coffee” drink that must’ve been 98% sugar and 2% coffee and/or coffee flavoring, served in an American-large plastic cup with a bright orange and pink straw.</description>

      <description>Hi friends!
I’m starting a series of blog posts exploring and detailing the life of a coffee bean from Earth’s ground to brewed grounds. I’ll be researching the journey starting on a coffee plantation, continuing through the stages of processing and shipping, all the way through roasting and sales, then finally ending with brewing methods used to enjoy a delicious cup.
My goal is to answer questions that bounce around in my head, as well as answer more basic coffee questions such as: Where and when does coffee grow?</description>
