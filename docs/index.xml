The earliest drink I can remember getting from Dunks was when I was in high school. It was their Hazelnut Coffee Coolata - a blended ice heavy-on-the-quotation-marks “coffee” drink that must’ve been 98% sugar and 2% coffee, served in an American-large plastic cup with a bright orange and pink straw. In classic New England fashion, ordering a cold coffee is graciously accepted year-round.</description>
